NatCam 1.3.

Video tutorials for NatCam will be posted very soon. See here for more information: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/natcam-device-camera-api.374690/
Below is a quick start guide.

Quick Start:
1. Create an empty game object and add the UnitygramBase component to it.
2. Create a UI panel with a RawImage and assign it to the UnitygramBase RawImage field in the inspector.
3. Build & Run!

See the Minigram example for a more detailed approach on using NatCam.
